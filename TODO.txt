1. Build the SP lists associated with the BANK Transaction and Allocation information, based on what we already have in production.
2. Build the bindings between JSpyder and BANK to display table data.
3. Build the left-side menu for subnav, dynamically.
4. Consider cannibalizing the BANK framework I started on NIPR.
